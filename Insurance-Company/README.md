## Overview
This project analyzes insurance policy data to identify factors that influence claim risk and predict total quoted payments. It applies multiple regression and classification modeling techniques using Python.

### Datasets
- TheGeneral.csv
- MasterQuote.csv

### Methods Used
- Explaratory Data Analysis
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Regression Modeling (Linear, Lasso, Ridge)
- Classification Modeling (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression)
- Model comparison and feature importance analysis

## Key Results
- Identified strongest predictors of claim risk and quote amount
- Compared model performance using RMSE, MAE and R^2 metrics
- Built interpretable models to inform insurance decision-making

### Tools and Libraries
Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
